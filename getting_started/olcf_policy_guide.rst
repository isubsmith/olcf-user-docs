prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to: classified
information, unclassified controlled nuclear information (UCNI), naval
nuclear propulsion information (NNPI), the design or development of
nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons or any weapons of mass
destruction. Authors/generators/owners of information are responsible
for its correct categorization as sensitive or non-sensitive. Owners of
sensitive information are responsible for its secure handling,
transmission, processing, storage, and disposal on OLCF systems.
Principal investigators, users, or project delegates that use OLCF
resources, or are responsible for overseeing projects that use OLCF
resources, are strictly responsible for knowing whether their project
generates any of these prohibited data types or information that falls
under Export Control. For questions, contact help@nccs.gov.

Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OLCF systems provide protections to maintain the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of user data. Measures include the
availability of file permissions, archival systems with access control
lists, and parity and CRC checks on data paths and files. It is the
user’s responsibility to set access controls appropriately for the data.
In the event of system failure or malicious actions, the OLCF makes no
guarantee against loss of data or that a user’s data can be accessed,
changed, or deleted by another individual. It is the user’s
responsibility to insure the appropriate level of backup and integrity
checks on critical data and programs.

Data Modification/Destruction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users are prohibited from taking unauthorized actions to intentionally
modify or delete information or programs.

Data Retention
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OLCF reserves the right to remove any data at any time and/or
transfer data to other users working on the same or similar project once
a user account is deleted or a person no longer has a business
association with the OLCF. After a sensitive project has ended or has
been terminated, all data related to the project must be purged from all
OLCF computing resources within 30 days.

Software Use
------------

All software used on OLCF computers must be appropriately acquired and
used according to the appropriate software license agreement.
Possession, use, or transmission of illegally obtained software is
prohibited. Likewise, users shall not copy, store, or transfer
copyrighted software, except as permitted by the owner of the copyright.
Only export-controlled codes approved by the Export Control Office may
be run by parties with sensitive data agreements.

Malicious Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users must not intentionally introduce or use malicious software such as
computer viruses, Trojan horses, or worms.

Reconstruction of Information or Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users are not allowed to reconstruct information or software for which
they are not authorized. This includes but is not limited to any reverse
engineering of copyrighted software or firmware present on OLCF
computing resources.

User Accountability
-------------------

Users are accountable for their actions and may be held accountable to
applicable administrative or legal sanctions.

Monitoring and Privacy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users are advised that there is no expectation of privacy of your
activities on any system that is owned by, leased or operated by
UT-Battelle on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The
Company retains the right to monitor all activities on these systems, to
access any computer files or electronic mail messages, and to disclose
all or part of information gained to authorized individuals or
investigative agencies, all without prior notice to, or consent from,
any user, sender, or addressee. This access to information or a system
by an authorized individual or investigative agency is in effect during
the period of your access to information on a DOE computer and for a
period of three years thereafter. OLCF personnel and users are required
to address, safeguard against, and report misuse, abuse and criminal
activities. Misuse of OLCF resources can lead to temporary or permanent
disabling of accounts, loss of DOE allocations, and administrative or
legal actions. Users who have not accessed a OLCF computing resource in
at least 6 months will be disabled. They will need to reapply to regain
access to their account. All users must reapply annually.

Authentication and Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All users are required to use a one-time password for authentication.
Tokens will be distributed to OLCF users. Users will be required to
create a Personal Identification Number (PIN). This is used in
conjunction with a generated token code as part of a two-factor
authentication implementation. Accounts on the OLCF machines are for the
exclusive use of the individual user named in the account application.
Users should not share accounts or tokens with anyone. If evidence is
found that more than one person is using an account, that account will
be disabled immediately. Users are not to attempt to receive unintended
messages or access information by some unauthorized means, such as
imitating another system, impersonating another user or other person,
misuse of legal user credentials (usernames, tokens, etc.), or by
causing some system component to function incorrectly. Users are
prohibited from changing or circumventing access controls to allow
themselves or others to perform actions outside their authorized
privileges. Users must notify the OLCF immediately when they become
aware that any of the accounts used to access OLCF have been
compromised. Users should inform the OLCF promptly of any changes in
their contact information (E-mail, phone, affiliation, etc.) Updates
should be sent to accounts@ccs.ornl.gov.

Foreign National Access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Applicants who appear on a restricted foreign country listing in section
15 CFR 740.7 License Exceptions for Computers are denied access based on
US Foreign Policy. The countries cited are Cuba, Iran, North Korea,
Sudan, and Syria. Additionally, no work may be performed on OLCF
computers on behalf of foreign nationals from these countries.

Denial of Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users may not deliberately interfere with other users accessing system
resources.  

Data Management Policy
======================

    **Note:** This details an official policy of the OLCF, and must be
    agreed to by the following persons as a condition of access to or use of
    OLCF computational resources:

    -  Principal Investigators (Non-Profit)
    -  Principal Investigators (Industry)
    -  All Users

    **Title:** Data Management Policy **Version:** 14.01

Introduction
------------

The OLCF provides a comprehensive suite of hardware and software
resources for the creation, manipulation, and retention of scientific
data. This document comprises guidelines for acceptable use of those
resources. It is an official policy of the OLCF, and as such, must be
agreed to by relevant parties as a condition of access to and use of
OLCF computational resources.

Data Storage Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OLCF provides an array of data storage platforms, each designed with
a particular purpose in mind. Storage areas are broadly divided into two
categories: those intended for user data and those intended for project
data. Within each of the two categories, we provide different sub-areas,
each with an intended purpose:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+----------------------------+
| Purpose                                                                                            | Storage Area        | Path                       |
+====================================================================================================+=====================+============================+
| Long-term data for routine access that is unrelated to a project                                   | *User Home*         | ``$HOME``                  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+----------------------------+
| Long-term data for archival access that is unrelated to a project                                  | *User Archive*      | ``/home/$USER``            |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+----------------------------+
| Long-term project data for routine access that's shared with other project members                 | *Project Home*      | ``/ccs/proj/[projid]``     |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+----------------------------+
| Short-term project data for fast, batch-job access that you don't want to share                    | *Member Work*       | ``$MEMBERWORK/[projid]``   |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+----------------------------+
| Short-term project data for fast, batch-job access that's shared with other project members        | *Project Work*      | ``$PROJWORK/[projid]``     |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+----------------------------+
| Short-term project data for fast, batch-job access that's shared with those outside your project   | *World Work*        | ``$WORLDWORK/[projid]``    |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+----------------------------+
| Long-term project data for archival access that's shared with other project members                | *Project Archive*   | ``/proj/[projid]``         |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+----------------------------+

User Home
^^^^^^^^^

Home directories for each user are NFS-mounted on all OLCF systems and
are intended to store long-term, frequently-accessed user data. User
Home areas are backed up on a daily basis. This file system does not
generally provide the input/output (I/O) performance required by most
compute jobs, and is not available to compute jobs on most systems. See
the section “Data Retention, Purge, & Quota Summary” for more details on
applicable quotas, backups, purge, and retention timeframes.

User Archive
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The High Performance Storage System (HPSS) is the tape-archive storage
system at the OLCF and is the storage technology that supports the User
Archive areas. HPSS is intended for data that do not require day-to-day
access. See the section “Data Retention, Purge, & Quota Summary” for
more details on applicable quotas, backups, purge, and retention
timeframes.

Project Home
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Project Home directories are NFS-mounted on selected OLCF systems and
are intended to store long-term, frequently-accessed data that is needed
by all collaborating members of a project. Project Home areas are backed
up on a daily basis. This file system does not generally provide the
input/output (I/O) performance required by most compute jobs, and is not
available to compute jobs on most systems. See the section “Data
Retention, Purge, & Quota Summary” for more details on applicable
quotas, backups, purge, and retention timeframes.

Member Work
^^^^^^^^^^^

Project members get an individual Member Work directory for each
associated project; these reside in the center-wide, high-capacity
Lustre\ :sup:`®` file system on large, fast disk areas intended for
global (parallel) access to temporary/scratch storage. Member Work
directories are provided commonly across all systems. Because of the
scratch nature of the file system, it is not backed up and files are
automatically purged on a regular basis. Files should not be retained in
this file system for long, but rather should be migrated to Project Home
or Project Archive space as soon as the files are not actively being
used. If a file system associated with your Member Work directory is
nearing capacity, the OLCF may contact you to request that you reduce
the size of your Member Work directory. See the section “Data Retention,
Purge, & Quota Summary” for more details on applicable quotas, backups,
purge, and retention timeframes.

Project Work
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Individual Project Work directories reside in the center-wide,
high-capacity Lustre file system on large, fast disk areas intended for
global (parallel) access to temporary/scratch storage. Project Work
directories are provided commonly across most systems. Because of the
scratch nature of the file system, it is not backed up. If a file system
associated with Project Work storage is nearing capacity, the OLCF may
contact the PI of the project to request that he or she reduce the size
of the Project Work directory. See the section “Data Retention, Purge, &
Quota Summary” for more details on applicable quotas, backups, purge,
and retention timeframes.

World Work
^^^^^^^^^^

Each project has a World Work directory that resides in the center-wide,
high-capacity Lustre file system on large, fast disk areas intended for
global (parallel) access to temporary/scratch storage. World Work
directories are provided commonly across most systems. Because of the
scratch nature of the file system, it is not backed up. If a file system
associated with World Work storage is nearing capacity, the OLCF may
contact the PI of the project to request that he or she reduce the size
of the World Work directory. See the section “Data Retention, Purge, &
Quota Summary” for more details on applicable quotas, backups, purge,
and retention timeframes.

Project Archive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The High Performance Storage System (HPSS) is the tape-archive storage
system at the OLCF and is the storage technology that supports the User
Archive areas. HPSS is intended for data that do not require day-to-day
access. Project Archive areas are shared between all users of the
project. Users should not store data unrelated to OLCF projects on HPSS.
Project members should also periodically review files and remove
unneeded ones. See the section “Data Retention, Purge, & Quota Summary”
for more details on applicable quotas, backups, purge, and retention
timeframes.

Local Scratch Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A large, fast disk area intended for parallel access to temporary
storage in the form of scratch directories may be provided on a limited
number of systems. This area is local to a specific system. This
directory is, for example, intended to hold output generated by a user's
job. Because of the scratch nature of the file system, it is not backed
up and files are automatically purged on a regular basis. Files should
not be retained in this file system and should be migrated to archival
storage as soon as the files are not actively being used. Quotas may be
instituted on a machine-by-machine basis if deemed necessary.

Data Retention, Purge, & Quotas
-------------------------------

Summary
^^^^^^^

The following table details quota, backup, purge, and retention
information for each user-centric and project-centric storage area
available at the OLCF.

**User-Centric Storage Areas**

+--------------+-----------------+------+-----------------+------------+---------+--------+-----------+

| *Retention -* Period of time, post-account-deactivation or post-project-end, after which data will be marked as eligible for permanent deletion.

    **Important!** Files within "Work" directories (i.e., Member Work,
    Project Work, World Work) are *not* backed up and are *purged* on a
    regular basis according to the timeframes listed above.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] In addition, there is a quota/limit of 2,000 files on this directory.

.. [#f2] Permissions on Member Work directories can be controlled to an extent by project members. By default, only the project member has any accesses, but accesses can be granted to other project members by setting group permissions accordingly on the Member Work directory. The parent directory of the Member Work directory prevents accesses by "UNIX-others" and cannot be changed (security measures).

.. [#f3] In addition, there is a quota/limit of 100,000 files on this directory.

.. [#f4] Retention is not applicable as files will follow purge cycle.

Data Retention Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, there is no lifetime retention for any data on OLCF
resources. The OLCF specifies a limited post-deactivation timeframe
during which user and project data will be retained. When the retention
timeframe expires, the OLCF retains the right to delete data. If you
have data retention needs outside of the default policy, please notify
the OLCF.

User Data Retention
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The user data retention policy exists to reclaim storage space after a
user account is deactivated, e.g., after the user’s involvement on all
OLCF projects concludes. By default, the OLCF will retain data in
user-centric storage areas only for a designated amount of time after
the user’s account is deactivated. During this time, a user can request
a temporary user account extension for data access. See the section
“Data Retention, Purge, & Quota Summary” for details on retention
timeframes for each user-centric storage area.

Project Data Retention
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The project data retention policy exists to reclaim storage space after
a project ends. By default, the OLCF will retain data in project-centric
storage areas only for a designated amount of time after the project end
date. During this time, a project member can request a temporary user
account extension for data access. See the section “Data Retention,
Purge, & Quota Summary” for details on purge and retention timeframes
for each project-centric storage area.

Sensitive Project Data Retention
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For sensitive projects only, all data related to the project must be
purged from all OLCF computing resources within 30 days of the project’s
end or termination date.

Data Purges
^^^^^^^^^^^

Data purge mechanisms are enabled on some OLCF file system directories
in order to maintain sufficient disk space availability for job
execution. Files in these scratch areas are automatically purged on a
regular purge timeframe. If a file system with an active purge policy is
nearing capacity, the OLCF may contact you to request that you reduce
the size of a directory within that file system, even if the purge
timeframe has not been exceeded. See the section “Data Retention, Purge,
& Quota Summary” for details on purge timeframes for each storage area,
if applicable.

Storage Space Quotas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each user-centric and project-centric storage area has an associated
quota, which could be a hard (systematically-enforceable) quota or a
soft (policy-enforceable) quota. Storage usage will be monitored
continually. When a user or project exceeds a soft quota for a storage
area, the user or project PI will be contacted and will be asked if at
all possible to purge data from the offending area. See the section
“Data Retention, Purge, & Quota Summary” for details on quotas for each
storage area.

Data Prohibitions & Safeguards
------------------------------

Prohibited Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OLCF computer systems are operated as research systems and only
contain data related to scientific research and do not contain
personally identifiable information (data that falls under the Privacy
Act of 1974 5U.S.C. 552a). Use of OLCF resources to store, manipulate,
or remotely access any national security information is strictly
prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to: classified
information, unclassified controlled nuclear information (UCNI), naval
nuclear propulsion information (NNPI), the design or development of
nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons or any weapons of mass
destruction. Authors/generators/owners of information are responsible
for its correct categorization as sensitive or non-sensitive. Owners of
sensitive information are responsible for its secure handling,
transmission, processing, storage, and disposal on OLCF systems.
Principal investigators, users, or project delegates that use OLCF
resources, or are responsible for overseeing projects that use OLCF
resources, are strictly responsible for knowing whether their project
generates any of these prohibited data types or information that falls
under Export Control. For questions, contact help@olcf.ornl.gov.

Unauthorized Data Modification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users are prohibited from taking unauthorized actions to intentionally
modify or delete information or programs.

Data Confidentiality, Integrity, & Availability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OLCF systems provide protections to maintain the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of user data. Measures include: the
availability of file permissions, archival systems with access control
lists, and parity/CRC checks on data paths/files. It is the user’s
responsibility to set access controls appropriately for data. In the
event of system failure or malicious actions, the OLCF makes no
guarantee against loss of data nor makes a guarantee that a user’s data
could not be potentially accessed, changed, or deleted by another
individual. It is the user’s responsibility to insure the appropriate
level of backup and integrity checks on critical data and programs.

Administrator Access to Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OLCF resources are federal computer systems, and as such, users should
have no explicit or implicit expectation of privacy. OLCF employees and
authorized vendor personnel with “root” privileges have access to all
data on OLCF systems. Such employees can also login to OLCF systems as
other users. As a general rule, OLCF employees will not discuss your
data with any unauthorized entities nor grant access to data files to
any person other than the UNIX “owner” of the data file, except in the
following situations:

-  When the owner of the data requests a change of ownership for any
   reason, e.g., the owner is leaving the project and grants the PI
   ownership of the data.
-  In situations of suspected abuse/misuse computational resources,
   criminal activity, or cyber-security violations.

Note that the above applies even to project PIs. In general, the OLCF
will not overwrite existing UNIX permissions on data files owned by
project members for the purpose of granting access to the project PI.
Project PIs should work closely with project members throughout the
duration of the project to ensure UNIX permissions are set
appropriately.

Software
--------

Software Licensing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All software used on OLCF computers must be appropriately acquired and
used according to the appropriate software license agreement.
Possession, use, or transmission of illegally obtained software is
prohibited. Likewise, users shall not copy, store, or transfer
copyrighted software, except as permitted by the owner of the copyright.
Only export-controlled codes approved by the Export Control Office may
be run by parties with sensitive data agreements.

Malicious Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users must not intentionally introduce or use malicious software,
including but not limited to, computer viruses, Trojan horses, or
computer worms.

Reconstruction of Information or Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users are not permitted to reconstruct information or software for which
they are not authorized. This includes but is not limited to any reverse
engineering of copyrighted software or firmware present on OLCF
computing resources.  

Security Policy
===============

    **Note:** This details an official policy of the OLCF, and must be
    agreed to by the following persons as a condition of access to or use of
    OLCF computational resources:

    -  Principal Investigators (Non-Profit)
    -  Principal Investigators (Industry)
    -  All Users

    **Title:**\ Security Policy **Version:** 12.10

The Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) computing resources
are provided to users for research purposes. All users must agree to
abide by all security measures described in this document. Failure to
comply with security procedures will result in termination of access to
OLCF computing resources and possible legal actions.

Scope
-----

The requirements outlined in this document apply to all individuals who
have an OLCF account. It is your responsibility to ensure that all
individuals have the proper need-to-know before allowing them access to
the information on OLCF computing resources. This document will outline
the main security concerns.

Personal Use
------------

OLCF computing resources are for business use only. Installation or use
of software for personal use is not allowed. Incidents of abuse will
result in account termination. Inappropriate uses include, but are not
limited to:

-  Sexually oriented information
-  Downloading, copying, or distributing copyrighted materials without
   prior permission from the owner
-  Downloading or storing large files or utilizing streaming media for
   personal use (e.g., music files, graphic files, internet radio, video
   streams, etc.)
-  Advertising, soliciting, or selling

Accessing OLCF Computational Resources
--------------------------------------

Access to systems is provided via Secure Shell version 2 (sshv2). You
will need to ensure that your ssh client supports keyboard-interactive
authentication. The method of setting up this authentication varies from
client to client, so you may need to contact your local administrator
for assistance. Most new implementations support this authentication
type, and many ssh clients are available on the web. Login sessions will
be automatically terminated after a period of inactivity. When you apply
for an account, you will be mailed an RSA SecurID token. You will also
be sent a request to complete identity verification. When your account is
approved, your RSA SecurID token will also be enabled. Please refer to our
:ref:`system-user-guides` for more information on host access. DO NOT share your
PIN or RSA SecurID token with anyone. Sharing of accounts will result in
termination. If your SecurID token is stolen or misplaced, contact the OLCF
immediately and report the missing token. Upon termination of your account
access, return the token to the OLCF in person or via mail.

Data Management
---------------

The OLCF uses a standard file system structure to assist users with data
organization on OLCF systems. Complete details about all file systems
available to OLCF users can be found in the Data Management Policy
section.

Sensitive Data
--------------

Additional file systems and file protections may be employed for
sensitive data. If you are a user on a project producing sensitive data,
further instructions will be given by the OLCF. The following guidelines
apply to sensitive data:

-  Only store sensitive data in designated locations. Do not store
   sensitive data in your User Home directory.
-  Never allow access to your sensitive data to anyone outside of your
   group.
-  Transfer of sensitive data must be through the use encrypted methods
   (scp, sftp, etc).
-  All sensitive data must be removed from all OLCF resources when your
   project has concluded.

Data Transfer
-------------

The OLCF offers a number of dedicated data transfer nodes to users. The nodes have been
tuned specifically for wide area data transfers, and also perform well on the
local area. There are also several utilities that the OLCF recommends for data
transfer. Please refer to our :ref:`system-user-guides` for information about
the DTNs and available utilities.

Titan Scheduling Policy

    **Title:** Titan Scheduling Policy **Version:** 13.02

In a simple batch queue system, jobs run in a first-in, first-out (FIFO)
order. This often does not make effective use of the system. A large job
may be next in line to run. If the system is using a strict FIFO queue,
many processors sit idle while the large job waits to run. *Backfilling*
would allow smaller, shorter jobs to use those otherwise idle resources,
and with the proper algorithm, the start time of the large job would not
be delayed. While this does make more effective use of the system, it
indirectly encourages the submission of smaller jobs.

The DOE Leadership-Class Job Mandate
------------------------------------

As a DOE Leadership Computing Facility, the OLCF has a mandate that a
large portion of Titan's usage come from large, *leadership-class* (aka
*capability*) jobs. To ensure the OLCF complies with DOE directives, we
strongly encourage users to run jobs on Titan that are as large as their
code will warrant. To that end, the OLCF implements queue policies that
enable large jobs to run in a timely fashion.

    **Note:** The OLCF implements queue policies that encourage the
    submission and timely execution of large, leadership-class jobs on
    Titan.

The basic priority-setting mechanism for jobs waiting in the queue is
the time a job has been waiting relative to other jobs in the queue.
However, several factors are applied by the batch system to modify the
*apparent* time a job has been waiting. These factors include:

-  The number of nodes requested by the job.
-  The queue to which the job is submitted.
-  The 8-week history of usage for the project associated with the job.
-  The 8-week history of usage for the user associated with the job.

If your jobs require resources outside these queue policies, please complete the
relevant request form on the `Special Requests
<https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/support/getting-started/special-request-form/>`__
page. If you have any questions or comments on the queue policies below, please
direct them to the User Assistance Center.

Job Priority by Processor Count
-------------------------------

Jobs are *aged* according to the job's requested processor count (older
age equals higher queue priority). Each job's requested processor count
places it into a specific *bin*. Each bin has a different aging
parameter, which all jobs in the bin receive.

+-------+-------------+-------------+------------------------+----------------------+
| Bin   | Min Nodes   | Max Nodes   | Max Walltime (Hours)   | Aging Boost (Days)   |
+=======+=============+=============+========================+======================+
| 1     | 11,250      | --          | 24.0                   | 15                   |
+-------+-------------+-------------+------------------------+----------------------+
| 2     | 3,750       | 11,249      | 24.0                   | 5                    |
+-------+-------------+-------------+------------------------+----------------------+
| 3     | 313         | 3,749       | 12.0                   | 0                    |
+-------+-------------+-------------+------------------------+----------------------+
| 4     | 126         | 312         | 6.0                    | 0                    |
+-------+-------------+-------------+------------------------+----------------------+
| 5     | 1           | 125         | 2.0                    | 0                    |
+-------+-------------+-------------+------------------------+----------------------+

FairShare Scheduling Policy
---------------------------

FairShare, as its name suggests, tries to push each user and project
towards their fair share of the system's utilization: in this case, 5%
of the system's utilization per user and 10% of the system's utilization
per project. To do this, the job scheduler adds (30) minutes priority
aging per user and (1) hour of priority aging per project for every (1)
percent the user or project is under its fair share value for the prior
(8) weeks. Similarly, the job scheduler subtracts priority in the same
way for users or projects that are over their fair share. For instance,
a user who has personally used 0.0% of the system's utilization over the
past (8) weeks who is on a project that has also used 0.0% of the
system's utilization will get a (12.5) hour bonus (5 \* 30 min for the
user + 10 \* 1 hour for the project). In contrast, a user who has
personally used 0.0% of the system's utilization on a project that has
used 12.5% of the system's utilization would get no bonus (5 \* 30 min
for the user - 2.5 \* 1 hour for the project).

``batch`` Queue Policy
----------------------

The ``batch`` queue is the default queue for production work on Titan.
Most work on Titan is handled through this queue. It enforces the
following policies:

-  Limit of (4) *eligible-to-run* jobs per user.
-  Jobs in excess of the per user limit above will be placed into a
   *held* state, but will change to eligible-to-run at the appropriate
   time.
-  Users may have only (2) jobs in bin 5 *running* at any time. Any
   additional jobs will be blocked until one of the running jobs
   completes.

    **Note:** The *eligible-to-run* state is not the *running* state.
    Eligible-to-run jobs have not started and are waiting for resources.
    Running jobs are actually executing.

``killable`` Queue Policy
-------------------------

At the start of a scheduled system outage, a *queue reservation* is used
to ensure that no jobs are running. In the ``batch`` queue, the
scheduler will not start a job if it expects that the job would not
complete (based on the job's user-specified max walltime) before the
reservation's start time. In constrast, the ``killable`` queue allows
the scheduler to start a job even if it will *not* complete before a
scheduled reservation. It enforces the following policies:

-  Jobs will be killed if still running when a system outage begins.
-  The scheduler will stop scheduling jobs in the ``killable`` queue (1)
   hour before a scheduled outage.
-  Maximum-job-per-user limits are the same (i.e., in conjunction with)
   the ``batch`` queue.
-  Any killed jobs will be automatically re-queued after a system outage
   completes.

``debug`` Queue Policy
----------------------

The ``debug`` queue is intended to provide faster turnaround times for
the code development, testing, and debugging cycle. For example,
interactive parallel work is an ideal use for the debug queue. It
enforces the following policies:

-  Production jobs are not allowed.
-  Maximum job walltime of (1) hour.
-  Limit of (1) job per user *regardless of the job's state*.
-  Jobs receive a (2)-day priority aging boost for scheduling.

    **Warning:** Users who misuse the ``debug`` queue may have further
    access to the queue denied.

Allocation Overuse Policy
-------------------------

Projects that overrun their allocation are still allowed to run on OLCF
systems, although at a reduced priority. Like the adjustment for the
number of processors requested above, this is an adjustment to the
apparent submit time of the job. However, this adjustment has the effect
of making jobs appear much younger than jobs submitted under projects
that have not exceeded their allocation. In addition to the priority
change, these jobs are also limited in the amount of wall time that can
be used. For example, consider that ``job1`` is submitted at the same
time as ``job2``. The project associated with ``job1`` is over its
allocation, while the project for ``job2`` is not. The batch system will
consider ``job2`` to have been waiting for a longer time than ``job1``.
Also projects that are at 125% of their allocated time will be limited
to only one running job at a time. The adjustment to the apparent submit
time depends upon the percentage that the project is over its
allocation, as shown in the table below:

+------------------------+----------------------+--------------------------+------------------+
| % Of Allocation Used   | Priority Reduction   | Number eligible-to-run   | Number running   |
+========================+======================+==========================+==================+
| < 100%                 | 0 days               | 4 jobs                   | unlimited jobs   |
+------------------------+----------------------+--------------------------+------------------+
| 100% to 125%           | 30 days              | 4 jobs                   | unlimited jobs   |
+------------------------+----------------------+--------------------------+------------------+
| > 125%                 | 365 days             | 4 jobs                   | 1 job            |
+------------------------+----------------------+--------------------------+------------------+

System Reservation Policy
-------------------------

Projects may request to reserve a set of processors for a period of time
through the reservation request form, which can be found on the `Special
Requests <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/support/getting-started/special-request-form/>`__
page. If the reservation is granted, the reserved processors will be
blocked from general use for a given period of time. Only users that
have been authorized to use the reservation can utilize those resources.
Since no other users can access the reserved resources, it is crucial
that groups given reservations take care to ensure the utilization on
those resources remains high. To prevent reserved resources from
remaining idle for an extended period of time, reservations are
monitored for inactivity. If activity falls below 50% of the reserved
resources for more than (30) minutes, the reservation will be canceled
and the system will be returned to normal scheduling. A new reservation
must be requested if this occurs. Since a reservation makes resources
unavailable to the general user population, projects that are granted
reservations will be charged (regardless of their actual utilization) a
CPU-time equivalent to
``(# of cores reserved) * (length of reservation in hours)``.

INCITE Allocation Under-utilization Policy
==========================================

    **Note:** This details an official policy of the OLCF, and must be
    agreed to by the following persons as a condition of access to and use
    of OLCF computational resources:

    -  INCITE Principal Investigators

    **Title:** INCITE Allocation Under-utilization Policy **Version:** 12.10

The OLCF has a *pull-back* policy for under-utilization of INCITE
allocations. Under-utilized INCITE project allocations will have
core-hours removed from their outstanding core-hour project balance at
specific times during the INCITE calendar year. The following table
summarizes the current under-utilization policy:

+-------------+---------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Date        | Utilization to-Date | Forfeited Amount                  |
+=============+=====================+===================================+
| May 1       | < 10%               | Up to 30% of remaining allocation |
+             +---------------------+-----------------------------------+
|             | < 15%               | Up to 15% of remaining allocation |
+-------------+---------------------+-----------------------------------+
| September 1 | < 10%               | Up to 75% of remaining allocation |
+             +---------------------+-----------------------------------+
|             | < 33%               | Up to 50% of remaining allocation |
+             +---------------------+-----------------------------------+
|             | < 50%               | Up to 33% of remaining allocation |
+-------------+---------------------+-----------------------------------+

For example, a 1,000,000 core-hour INCITE project that has utilized only
50,000 core-hours (5% of the allocation) on May 1st would forfeit (0.30
\* 950,000) = 285,000 core-hours from their remaining allocation.  

Project Reporting Policy
========================

    **Note:** This details an official policy of the OLCF, and must be
    agreed to by the following persons as a condition of access to and use
    of OLCF computational resources:

    -  Principal Investigators (Non-Profit)
    -  Principal Investigators (Industry)

    **Title:** Project Reporting Policy **Version:** 12.10

Principal Investigators of current OLCF projects must submit a quarterly
progress report. The quarterly reports are essential as the OLCF must
diligently track the use of the center's resources. In keeping with
this, the OLCF (and DOE Leadership Computing Facilities in general)
imposes the following penalties for late submission:

+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Timeframe       | Penalty                                                                                                      |
+=================+==============================================================================================================+
| 1 Month Late    | Job submissions against offending project will be suspended.                                                 |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3 Months Late   | Login privileges will be suspended for all OLCF resources for all users associated with offending project.   |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
